      "body": "&quot;We made changes a couple of years ago where we decided to get away from doing just one project every four years. There were structural reasons why we had to do that. There was the pace of technology and how long it took to create a new game technology. Then there was the time it took to train the game team how to use the technology to make a game. It was clear that we had to leverage our technology and get things into a pipeline. All the publishers were telling us that it was wise to license out our intellectual property to get more projects under way at once. The publishers told us that we would be more valuable to them if we built our team larger. So we listened to that. We took games pretty far into development on our own nickel before pitching the publishers. That’s what we did with Rage. That was our plan of record.&quot;",
